Torshield

A Defense Proposed for Deep Learning based attacks on Tor.

The defense works on the principle on adversarial machine learning that is to modify the traffic traces with minimum perturbations to lead to misclassification by adversary's model.

To Generate Adversarial Traces:python3 GenerateTraces.py

To Test Adversary Model on above generated traces: python3 test.py
